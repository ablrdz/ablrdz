# Hi! I'm Abel üêô
**Software Engineer**

I'm a Software Engineer, currently working as a full-time Hybrid Mobile Developer [@Norfolk-Southern](https://www.github.com/norfolk-southern).  
While my professional focus has been on web and hybrid technologies such as Angular and Ionic, I also enjoy making small video games as side projects. 

Feel free to visit my [personal website](https://www.ablrdz.com/) and [itch.io profile](https://ablrdz.itch.io/) to see some of my projects.
